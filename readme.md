Sequential (not concurrent) multiprotocol using Nordic NRF radio SoC.

Switches sequentially between BLE and proprietary protocols.
Radio and other HW devices used sequentially by protocols.

Use BLE to create a BT peripheral that briefly advertises a characteristic (property)
that a control app (a BT central) can write.
The control app has plenty of power to scan for the peripheral, which sleeps mostly.

The goal is a standalone app that advertises a characteristic, periodically,
shutting down the SoftDevice in between.

Then the goal is to make it a library
and integrate with an app that uses a proprietary protocol most of the time.

Status
-

 work in progress, not working.

Initially derived from NRF SDK examples/multiprotocol/ble_app_gzll
Modified to be object oriented: more understandable and modifiable.
Then derived from examples/ble_peripheral/ble_app_template, which uses more abstractions from the SDK.

Project is C++
Some hacks necessary to get C code to compile with C++
Project uses Eclipse managed make (no makefile, uses Project>Properties)

Architecture
-

Layers
    - Facade classes
    - Modules from SDK
    - SD
    
Modules from SDK require linking in certain .c files that implement the modules on top of SD.  Modules abtract away some complexities of the alternative: dealing with certain SD events yourself.

The SD is closed source.  SD usually burned to flash in a separate step.  Requires linking to SD headers.  Calls to the SD are via SVC instruction.  Callbacks with events from SD to registered handlers.


Dependencies
-

SDK 14.2

NRF52K

SD132

Burn it to NRF52DK along with SD 132 or 112?

Test it with NRF app for iPhone "NRF Connect."



Configuration
-

In general, the project properties must be set to mimic the Makefile from the example ble_app_template.
What is described here may not correspond to actual project properties.

Preprocessor symbols in Project Properties

    NRF_SD_BLE_API_VERSION=3
    NRF52
    BLE_STACK_SUPPORT_REQD

No BOARD symbol defined (buttons and leds not used.)


sdk_config.h

    NRF_SDH_BLE_VS_UUID_COUNT = 2       since using two vendor specifig UUIDS

Used many settings from ble_app_template's sdk_configh.h
such as NRF_FSTORAGE_ENABLED (when using Advertising module)

Currently enable these modules:


    BLE_ADVERTISING_ENABLED 1
    NRF_BLE_CONN_PARAMS_ENABLED 1
    NRF_BLE_GATT_ENABLED 1
    
    NRF_FSTORAGE_ENABLED 1	 required by advertising module
    
Not using Peer Manager module (not interested in bonding BT devices.)
    
    


Linker script
-

Modified to allow plenty or room for SD ram.
You can use the process described on Nordic website: you use the debugger to determine the optimal start address of application RAM: step through until the code where ram_start value is returned by the SD.


Other Notes
-

I started with SDK 12.3, there may be improper vestiges of that.

At first, I copied source from SDK into project and change their suffix to .cpp.
They should be linked files, and C flags created properly.
